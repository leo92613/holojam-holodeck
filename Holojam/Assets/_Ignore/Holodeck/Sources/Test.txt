Hey Wenbo,
It’s that creepy, crawly season again, and everyone knows where the monsters are hanging out. Under the bed. In the abandoned mineshaft.
And…on your credit report? Yep, they could be there too.
Maybe it’s an accidental missed payment, draining your score like a credit-thirsty vampire. Or maybe it’s an account you didn’t actually open, peeking its head out like a trouble-making goblin.
But you’re tough enough to fight them off, Wenbo. You’re doing a great job of checking in, and your score's been looking awesome. Keep it up!
