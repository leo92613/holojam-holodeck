1GUS: I wouldn't like to live in this
1    dump.  I wouldn't mind if you had a
1    window, you could see what it looked
1    like outside.  
2BEN: What do you want a
2    window for?  
1    GUS: Well I like to have a
1    bit of a view, Ben. It whiles away the
1    time.  I mean, you come into a place
1    when it's still dark, you come into a
1    room you've never seen before, you sleep
1    all day, you do your job, and then you
1    go away in the night again.  I like to
1    get a look at the scenery. You never get
1    the chance in this job.  
2BEN: You get your holidays don't you?  
1GUS: Only a fortnight.  
2BEN: You kill me. Anyone
2    would think you're working every
2    day. How often do we do a job? Once a
2    week? What are you complaining about?
1GUS: Yes but we've got to be on tap
1    though, haven't we? You can't move out
1    of the house in case a call comes.  
2BEN: You know what your trouble is?  
1GUS: What?  
2BEN: You haven't got any interests.  
1GUS: I've got interests.
2BEN: What? Tell me one of your
2    interests.  
1GUS: I've got interests.
2BEN: Look at me. What have I got?  
1GUS: I don't know. What?  
2BEN: I've got my woodwork. I've got my 
2     model boats. Have you ever seen me idle? 
2     I'm never idle. I know how to occupy my 
2     time to its best advantage. Then when 
2     a call comes, I'm ready.  
1GUS: Don't you ever get a bit fed up?  
2BEN: Fed up? With what?
1GUS: You got any cigarettes? I've run out.
