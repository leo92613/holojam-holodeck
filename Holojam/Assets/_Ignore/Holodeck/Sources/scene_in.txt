1GUY: In a moment it’ll be my stop.
2GAL: Don’t you need to get ready to go?
1GUY: It’s ok. I can get out at the next stop.
1     I’m really enjoying talking with you.
2GAL: Does that mean you want to hear
2     the rest of my theory?
1GUY: Definitely. You were talking about demons,
1     and desire.
2GAL: Yes. I think demons use desire as a way
2     to steal time. It’s their power.
2     People’s lives generally move forward,
2     until they meet their demon.
2     The jealous demon takes that away.
1GUY: Hmm. Like demon alcohol, right?
2GAL: Exactly! The moment an alcoholic
2     takes that first drink,
2     life begins to stop moving forward.
1GUY: I see what you’re saying. After that,
1     all the alcoholic does
1     is circle around that bottle.
1     The demon wins.
2GAL: You catch on quick.
2     Have you studied philosophy?
1GUY: No, but maybe I should.
1     Oh wait, here we are.
1     In a moment it’ll be my stop.
2GAL: Don’t you need to get ready to go?
1GUY: It’s ok, I can get out at the next stop.
1     I’m really enjoying talking with you.
