2 VLADIMIR: I'm beginning to come round
2 to that
2  opinion. All my life I've tried
2 to put it from
2  me, saying Vladimir, be reasonable,
2 you haven't 
2  yet tried everything. And I resumed the struggle. 
2  So there you are again.
1 ESTRAGON: Am I?
2 VLADIMIR: I'm glad to see you back.
2 I thought you 
2  were gone forever.
1 ESTRAGON: Me too.
2 VLADIMIR: Together again at last!
2 We'll have to 
2  celebrate this. But how?
2 Get up till I embrace you.
1 ESTRAGON: Not now, not now.
2 VLADIMIR: May one inquire
2 where His Highness 
1  spent the night?
1 ESTRAGON: In a ditch.
2 VLADIMIR: A ditch! Where?
1 ESTRAGON: Over there.
2 VLADIMIR: And they didn't beat you?
1 ESTRAGON: Beat me? Certainly they beat me.
2 VLADIMIR: The same lot as usual?
1 ESTRAGON: The same? I don't know.
2 VLADIMIR: When I think of it. All these years. 
2  but for me. where would you be. You'd be 
2  nothing more than a little
2 heap of bones at the 
2  present minute, no doubt about it.
1 ESTRAGON: And what of it?
2 VLADIMIR: It's too much for one man.
2 On the other 
2  hand what's the good of losing heart now,
2  that's 
2  what I say. We should have
2 thought of it a million 
2  years ago, in the nineties.
1 ESTRAGON: Ah stop blathering
1 and help me off with
1  this bloody thing.
